## In progress

I make my projects, which reflect my professional experience and technical expertise, available through my GitHub account. These projects provide valuable resources for users interested in Hackintosh installations as well as various software and system configurations. Supported with detailed documentation and regular updates, my projects serve as a guide for both beginner users and advanced developers.
