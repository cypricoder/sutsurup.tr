## How to Build a Hackintosh

Building a Hackintosh requires careful planning and technical knowledge. Here are the basic steps:

Choose Compatible Hardware
Select components compatible with macOS. It’s important to consult Hackintosh community recommendations, especially for the motherboard, CPU, and graphics card.

Prepare the macOS Installation File
Obtain the macOS installer using a genuine Mac or a system that can run macOS.

Create a Bootable USB Installer
Use tools like UniBeast or similar to create a bootable USB drive.

Configure BIOS Settings
Adjust the motherboard BIOS/UEFI settings for Hackintosh installation (e.g., enable AHCI mode, disable secure boot).

Install macOS
Boot from the prepared USB drive and proceed with the macOS installation.

Install Necessary Drivers and Kexts
Install appropriate drivers and kext files to ensure full compatibility with your system components.

Set Up a Bootloader
Use a bootloader like Clover or OpenCore to allow the system to boot independently.

You can also find installation tips in the projects I’ve shared on my GitHub account. Feel free to check out the My Hackintosh Projects page.
