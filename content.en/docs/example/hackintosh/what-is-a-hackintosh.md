## What is a Hackintosh?

A Hackintosh is a computer that runs Apple’s macOS operating system on non-Apple hardware (typically standard PC components). Users employ special software and drivers to achieve a macOS experience on devices not officially supported by Apple. This process requires technical knowledge and is not officially endorsed by Apple.

## Why Build a Hackintosh?

Many users choose to build a Hackintosh to access macOS without the high cost of Apple hardware. For developers, especially those creating apps with Xcode, a Hackintosh provides a budget-friendly solution to run macOS and develop iOS or macOS apps. Additionally, users who prefer macOS for its stability and user-friendly experience can enjoy these benefits on custom-built systems tailored to their needs.

## Xcode and Hardware Accessibility

Xcode is Apple’s official development environment and runs exclusively on macOS. Therefore, anyone looking to develop iOS or macOS applications must use macOS. However, in many countries, Apple hardware can be expensive and difficult to obtain due to high prices and limited availability. A Hackintosh offers a practical alternative for users who want to overcome these barriers and develop at a more affordable cost.
