# UI/UX Design

**User Interface (UI)** and **User Experience (UX)** design are two of the most often confused and conflated terms in web and app design. And understandably so. They’re usually placed together in a single term, UI/UX design, and they are very related.

## UI (User Interface) Design
UI design is the graphical layout of an application. It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields, and all the rest of the items the user interacts with. This includes screen layout, transitions, interface animations and every single micro-interaction. Any sort of visual element, interaction, or animation must all be designed.

## UX (User Experience) Design
UX design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product. UX design is not about visuals; it focuses on the overall feel of the experience.

In web projects, user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design processes are conducted in accordance with modern standards. The functionality and intuitive usability of interfaces are ensured; design decisions are made based on user interaction data and accessibility principles. Additionally, AI-powered analysis tools and innovative systems are employed to streamline design processes and minimize the margin of error.
